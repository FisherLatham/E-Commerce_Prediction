# E-Commerce_Prediction
---
In 2020 the world shutdown: Everything that we were accustomed to doing in person became virutal. This is especially true for shopping. Granted, E-Commerce was already becoming more popular prior to the pandemic. The pandemic merely amplified E-Commerce activity as buying through E-Commerce shops quickly became a safe option to avoid the rapid spread of COVID. So naturally, when I cam across this anynonmous E-Commerce datset from Kaggle, I knew that I wanted to develop a project around it. After looking more into it, I saw that the data spanned from October 2019 to April 2020, which sparked a couple of ideas.

First, I was curious about the relationship between COVID-19 and E-Commerce sales. Then the data science nerd in me was intriuged by the idea of merging a bunch of different datasets together. This ultimately led to a bigger project; Using daily COVID-19 confirmed cases, different E-Commerce stocks, the SP500, US presidential polling data, and other E-Commerce information how accurately could I predict daily revenue? Since most of this free data is reported daily, I decided to predict daily revenue.

I was (am) excited as this is my first individual data science project. I truly feel passionate about this project and hope you enjoy looking at it!
